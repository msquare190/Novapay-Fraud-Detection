Novapay Advanced Fraud Detection System
Business Challenge
Financial institutions face significant losses and reputational damage due to fraudulent transactions. The challenge is to accurately identify and prevent fraud in real-time while minimizing disruption to legitimate customer activity.
Solution
I developed and implemented an advanced machine learning-based fraud detection system utilizing a Tuned Random Forest Classifier. This solution integrates comprehensive data analysis, sophisticated feature engineering (leveraging transaction velocity, account age, and risk scores), and model interpretability with SHAP to deliver a robust and transparent fraud prevention capability.
Key Achievements & Business Impact
•	Exceptional Accuracy: The system achieved an outstanding ROC-AUC of 0.9754 on unseen data.
•	Zero False Positives for Fraud: Critically, the model delivered 100% Precision for fraud detection on the test set. This means no legitimate customer transactions were incorrectly flagged as fraudulent, drastically reducing operational costs associated with manual reviews and improving customer experience.
•	High Fraud Capture Rate: The model successfully identified 92% of all fraudulent transactions (Recall), significantly mitigating potential financial losses.
•	Actionable Insights: Integration of SHAP explanations provides fraud analysts with clear, business-understandable reasons behind each fraud alert, enabling faster and more informed decisions.
Strategic Value
This solution empowers the business with a highly effective and efficient tool to combat financial fraud, safeguard assets, and maintain customer trust. By combining high predictive power with transparent interpretability, it enhances operational efficiency and provides a competitive edge in risk management.
