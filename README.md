# Novapay-Fraud-Detection

I developed the **Novapay Advanced Fraud Detection System** using a tuned Random Forest model to detect fraudulent transactions in real time. The system achieved a **ROC-AUC of 0.9754**, 100% precision (zero false fraud alerts), and 92% fraud detection recall. By combining strong predictive performance with SHAP-based explainability, it reduces financial losses, improves customer experience, and strengthens risk management.
